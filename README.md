Index2 was created as as statement on my experience reading the first chapter of A Pattern language. I felt like I was looking up a lot of phrases, words, and concepts in order to understand what the author was trying to get across to me. So, I spaced out all of the key words and nouns, only leaving the inbetween words, in order to emphasize the need to carefully read the book to understand. The structure of the letters also descend to form a Pattern, formed from the Language.
