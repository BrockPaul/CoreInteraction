        This is an archive of guitar fingerstyle videos and their corresponding
        fingerstyle tabs. I created this archive due to the lack of tablature
        and song connection on the internet. Lots of youtube fingerstylists make
        beautiful arrangements that get millions of views and exposure, and
        people really want to play these songs. The issue though, is that not
        everyone is good at the art of fingerstyle tabbing, or doesn't have good
        ear, but would still like to play these songs. This archive remedies
        that in the sense where everything you need to play the song is here for
        you. People seem to think that playing these fingerstyle arrangements is
        daunting and impossible, people just want to quit guitar when they see
        someone pay soething amazing. I get inspired by the challenge, and I
        think that when people see the tab next to the song that they will not
        be as afraid, and I encourage you all to attempt learning what you want
        to learn.
