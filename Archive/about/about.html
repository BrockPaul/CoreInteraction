      This is an archive of guitar fingerstyle videos and their corresponding
      fingerstyle tabs. I created this archive due to the lack of tablature
      and song connection on the internet. Lots of youtube fingerstylists make
      beautiful arrangements that get millions of views and exposure, and
      people really want to play these songs. The issue though, is that not
      everyone is good at the art of fingerstyle tabbing, or doesn't have good
      ear, but would still like to play these songs. This archive remedies
      that in the sense where everything you need to play the song is here for
      you. People seem to think that playing these fingerstyle arrangements is
      daunting and impossible, people just want to quit guitar when they see
      someone pay soething amazing. I get inspired by the challenge, and I
      think that when people see the tab next to the song that they will not
      be as afraid, and I encourage you all to attempt learning what you want
      to learn.
