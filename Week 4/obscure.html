        A PATTERN LANGUAGE TOWNS • BUILDINGS • CONSTRUCTION Chris top her
        Alexander Sara Ishikawa Murray Silverstein with Max Jacobson Ingrid
        Fiksdahl-King Shlomo Angel NEW YORK OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS 1977 SUMMARY
        OF THE LANGUAGE A pattern language has the structure of a network. This
        is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However, when we use
        the network of a language, we always use it as a sequence) going through
        the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,
        always from the ones which create structures, to the ones which then
        embellish those structures, and then to those which embellish the
        embellishments .... Since the language is in truth a network, there is
        no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se­ quence which
        follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it
        follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular
        course, a little like a needle following a tapestry. The sequence of
        patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an
        index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences which connect
        the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over­ view of the
        whole language. And once you get this over­ view, you will then be able
        to find the patterns which are relevant to your own project. And
        finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of
        patterns is also the "base map," from XVII! SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE

        patterns which are most useful to you, and leaving them more or less in
        the order that you find them printed here. + + + We begin with that part
        of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can
        never be "de­ signed" or "built" in one fell swoop-but patient piece­
        meal growth, designed in such a way that every indi­ vidual act is
        always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will,
        slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these
        global patterns in it. I. INDEPENDENT REGIONS within each region work

        IN PUBLIC This completes the global patterns which define a town or a
        community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to
        groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three
        dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or
        "built"-the patterns which define the individual build­ ings and the
        space between buildings; where we are deal­ ing for the first time with
        patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of
        individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once. The first
        group of patterns helps to lay out the overall arrangement of a group of
        buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to
        the site, main parking areas, and lines of movement through the com­
        plex; 95. BUILDING COMPLEX 96. NUMBER OF STORIES 97. SHIELDED PARKING

        the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the
        site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in
        the language; 104. SITE REPAIR 105. SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS 106. POSITIVE

        same time-remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang,

        for an in­ dividual building. If you have fallowed the patterns given,
        you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes,
        or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the
        height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and
        you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid
        out. The next, and last part of the language, tells how to XXXI SUMMARY
        OF THE LANGUAGE make a buildable building directly from this rough
        scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail. Before you
        lay out structural details, establish a philosophy of structure which
        will let the structure grow directly from your plans and your conception
        of the buildings; 205. STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES 206. EFFICIENT

        IN PUBLIC This completes the global patterns which define a town or a
        community. We now start that part of the language which gives shape to
        groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three
        dimensions. These are the patterns which can be "designed" or
        "built"-the patterns which define the individual build­ ings and the
        space between buildings; where we are deal­ ing for the first time with
        patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of
        individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once. The first
        group of patterns helps to lay out the overall arrangement of a group of
        buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to
        the site, main parking areas, and lines of movement through the com­
        plex; 95. BUILDING COMPLEX 96. NUMBER OF STORIES 97. SHIELDED PARKING

        xxv SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE fix the position of individual buildings on
        the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the
        site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in
        the language; 104. SITE REPAIR 105. SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS 106. POSITIVE

        buildings and the volume of the space be­ tween the buildings at the
        same time-remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang,
        must always get their shape together; IIO. MAIN ENTRANCE l l I.

        ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the
        build­ ings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the
        fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect
        the spaces in the gradients; 127. INTIMACY GRADIENT 128. INDOOR SUNLIGHT

        CHILD CAVES 204. SECRET PLACE At this stage, you have a complete design
        for an in­ dividual building. If you have fallowed the patterns given,
        you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes,
        or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the
        height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and
        you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid
        out. The next, and last part of the language, tells how to XXXI SUMMARY
        OF THE LANGUAGE make a buildable building directly from this rough
        scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail. Before you
        lay out structural details, establish a philosophy of structure which
        will let the structure grow directly from your plans and your conception
        of the buildings; 205. STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES 206. EFFICIENT
