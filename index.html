                                                                  SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE<br> <br>
A pattern language has the structure of a network. This                   Since the language is in truth a network, there is no<br>

moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,                     dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little<br>
always from the ones which create structures, to the ones                like a needle following a tapestry. <br>
which then embellish those structures, and then to those<br>
which embellish the embellishments .... <br><br>


The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the                         And finally, as we shall explain in the next section,<br>
language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.                 this sequence of patterns is also the "base map," from <br>

groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over­                    by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,<br>
view of the whole language. And once you get this over­                 and leaving them more or less in the order that you<br>
view, you will then be able to find the patterns which                      find them printed here.
are relevant to your own project. <br><br>

<br><br>
                                                                                              + + + <br><br><br>
                                                                  We begin with that part of the language which defines<br>
                                                                  a town or community. These patterns can never be "de­<br>
                                                                  signed" or "built" in one fell swoop-but patient piece­<br>
                                                                  meal growth, designed in such a way that every indi­<br>
                                                                  vidual act is always helping to create or generate these<br>
                                                                  larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the<br>
                                                                  years, make a community that has these global patterns<br>
                                                                  in it. <br><br>
                                                                                I. INDEPENDENT REGIONS <br><br>
                                                                  within each region work toward those regional policies<br>
                                                                  which will protect the land and mark the limits of the<br>

<br><br>
                                                                  This completes the global patterns which define a<br>
                                                                  town or a community. We now start that part of the<br>
                                                                  language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and<br>
                                                                  individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions.<br>
                                                                  These are the patterns which can be "designed" or<br>
                                                                  "built"-the patterns which define the individual build­<br>
                                                                  ings and the space between buildings; where we are deal­<br>
                                                                  ing for the first time with patterns that are under the<br>
                                                                  control of individuals or small groups of individuals,<br>
                                                                  who are able to build the patterns all at once. <br>
                                                                  The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall<br>
                                                                  arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and<br>
                                                                  number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main<br>
                                                                  parking areas, and lines of movement through the com­<br>

                                                                  site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important<br>

                                                                  within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the<br>
                                                                  gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the<br>
                                                                  volume of the buildings and the volume of the space be­<br>
                                                                  tween the buildings at the same time-remembering<br>
                                                                  that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must<br>
                                                                  always get their shape together; <br><br>
