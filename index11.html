<em>SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE</em> <br><br>
<p class="intro">A pattern language has the structure of a network. This<br>
is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building. <br>
However, when we use the network of a language, we<br>
always use it as a sequence) going through the patterns,<br>
moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,<br>
always from the ones which create structures, to the ones<br>
which then embellish those structures, and then to those<br>
which embellish the embellishments .... <br><br>

Since the language is in truth a network, there is no<br>
one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se­<br>
quence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the<br>
full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,<br>
dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little<br>
like a needle following a tapestry.<br><br>

The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the<br>
language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.<br> 
If you read through the sentences which connect the<br>
groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over<br>­ 
view of the whole language. And once you get this over­<br>
view, you will then be able to find the patterns which<br>
are relevant to your own project. <br><br>

And finally, as we shall explain in the next section,<br>
this sequence of patterns is also the "base map," from <br>
which you can make a language for your own project,<br>
by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,<br>
and leaving them more or less in the order that you<br>
find them printed here. <br><br>
+ + + <br><br>
We begin with that part of the language which defines<br>
a town or community. These patterns can never be "de­<br>
signed" or "built" in one fell swoop-but patient piece­<br>
meal growth, designed in such a way that every indi­<br>
vidual act is always helping to create or generate these<br>
larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the<br>
years, make a community that has these global patterns<br>
in it. <br><br>

I. INDEPENDENT REGIONS <br><br>
within each region work toward those regional policies<br>
which will protect the land and mark the limits of the<br>
cities; <br>
<ul>
    <li>2. THE DISTRIBUTION OF TOWNS </li>
    <li>3· CITY COUNTRY FINGERS </li>
    <li>4· AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS </li>
    <li>5· LACE OF COUNTRY STREETS </li>
    <li>6. COUNTRY TOWNS </li>
    <li>7· THE COUNTRYSIDE</li>
  </ul>
through city policies, encourage the piecemeal forma­<br>
tion of those major structures which define the city; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>8. MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES </li>
    <li>9, SCATTERED WORK </li>
    <li>10. MAGIC OF THE CITY </li>
    <li>I I. LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS</li>
  </ul>
build up these larger city patterns from the grass roots,<br>
through action essentially controlled by two levels of<br>
self-governing communities, which exist as physically<br>
identifiable places; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>12. COMMUNITY OF 7(XX) </li>
    <li>IJ. SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY </li>
    <li>14. IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD </li>
    <li>15. NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY</li>
  </ul>
connect communities to one another by encouraging the<br>
growth of the following networks; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>16. WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION </li>
    <li>17. RING ROADS </li>
    <li>I 8. NETWORK OF LEARNING </li>
    <li>19. WEB OF SHOPPING </li>
    <li>20, MINI-BUSES</li>
  </ul>
establish community and neighborhood policy to con­<br>
trol the character of the local environment according to <br>
the following fundamental principles; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>21. FOUR-STORY LIMIT </li>
    <li>22. NINE PER CENT PARKING </li>
    <li>23. PARALLEL ROADS </li>
    <li>24. SACRED SITES </li>
    <li>25. ACCESS TO WATER </li>
    <li>26. LIFE CYCLE </li>
    <li>27. MEN AND WOMEN</li>
  </ul>
both in the neighborhoods and the communities, and m<br>
between them, in the boundaries, encourage the forma­<br>
tion of local centers; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>28.ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS </li>
    <li>29.DENSITY RINGS </li>
    <li>30.ACTIVITY NODES </li>
    <li>32. PROMENADE </li>
    <li>32.SHOPPING STREET  </li>
    <li>34. NIGHT LIFE INTERCHANGE</li>
  </ul>
around these centers, provide for the growth of housing<br>
in the form of clusters, based on face-to-face human<br>
groups; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>35· HOUSEHOLD MIX </li>
    <li>36. DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS </li>
    <li>37· HOUSE CLUSTER </li>
    <li>J8. ROW HOUSES </li>
    <li>39· HOUSING HILL </li>
    <li>40. OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE</li>
  </ul>
between the house clusters, around the centers, and<br>
especially in the boundaries between neighborhoods, en­<br>
courage the formation of work communities; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>4I. WORK COMMUNITY </li>
    <li>42. INDUSTRIAL RIBBON </li>
    <li>43· UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE </li>
    <li>44. LOCAL TOWN HALL </li>
    <li>45. NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS </li>
    <li>46. MARKET OF MANY SHOPS </li>
    <li>47· HEALTH CENTER </li>
    <li>48. HOUSING IN BETWEEN</li>
  </ul>
between the house clusters and work communities, allow<br>
the local road and path network to grow informally,<br>
piecemeal; <br><br>
<ul>
    <li>49. LOOPED LOCAL ROADS </li>
    <li>50. T JUNCTIONS </li>
    <li>51. GREEN STREETS </li>
    <li>52. NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS </li>
    <li>53. MAIN GATEWAYS </li>
    <li>54. ROAD CROSS! NC </li>
    <li>55. RAISED WALK </li>
    <li>56. BIKE PATHS AND RACKS </li>
    <li>57· CHILDREN IN THE CITY</li>
  </ul>
in the communities and neighborhoods, provide public<br>
open land where people can relax, rub shoulders and<br>
renew themselves; <br><br>
<ul>
  <li>58. CARNIVAL</li> 
<li>59. ANIMALS</li>
</ul>
in each house cluster and work community, provide the<br>
smaller bits of common land, to provide for local ver­<br>
sions of the same needs; <br>
<ul>
	<li>67. COMMON LAND </li>
	<li>68.CONNECTED PLAY </li>
	<li>69. PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM </li>
	<li>70. GRAVE SITES </li>
	<li>71. STILL WATER </li>
	<li>72. LOCAL SPORTS </li>
	<li>73. ADVENTURE</li>
	<li>74. QUIET BACKS </li>
	<li>60. ACCESSIBLE GREEN </li>
	<li>61. SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES </li>
	<li>62. HIGH PLACES </li>
	<li>63. DANCING IN THE STREET </li>
	<li>64. POOLS AND STREAMS </li>
	<li>65. BIRTH PLACES </li>
	<li>66. HOLY GROUND</li>
</ul>
within the framework of the common land, the clusters,<br>
and the work communities encourage transformation of <br>
the smallest independent social institutions: the families,<br>
workgroups, and gathering places. The family, in all its<br>
forms; <br><br>
<ul>
	<li>75. THE FAMILY </li>
	<li>76. HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY </li>
	<li>77. HOUSE FOR A COUPLE </li>
	<li>78. HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON </li>
	<li>79. YOUR OWN HOME</li>
</ul>
the workgroups, including all kinds of workshops and<br>
offices and even children's learning groups; <br><br>
<ul>
	<li>80. SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS</li>
	<li>AND OFFICES </li>
	<li>8 I. SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE </li>
	<li>82. OFFICE CONNECTIONS </li>
	<li>83. MASTER AND APPRENTICES </li>
	<li>84. TEENAGE SOCIETY </li>
	<li>85. SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS </li>
	<li>86. CHILDREN'S HOME </li>
	<li>the local shops and gathering places.</li>
	<li>87. INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS </li>
	<li>88. STREET CAFE </li>
	<li>89. CORNER GROCERY </li>
	<li>90. BEER HALL </li>
	<li>91. TRAVELER'S LNN </li>
	<li>92. BUS STOP </li>
	<li>93, FOOD ST ANDS </li>
	<li>94· SLEEPING IN PUBLIC</li>
</ul>
This completes the global patterns which define a<br>
town or a community. We now start that part of the<br>
language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and<br>
individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions.<br>
These are the patterns which can be "designed" or<br>
"built"-the patterns which define the individual build­<br>
ings and the space between buildings; where we are deal­<br>
ing for the first time with patterns that are under the<br>
control of individuals or small groups of individuals,<br>
who are able to build the patterns all at once. <br>
The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall<br>
arrangement of a group of buildings: <br>
